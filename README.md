Trading Assistant is an application designed to provide a user-friendly interface for managing hedged portfolios with [Interactive Brokers (IBKR)](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/). Connecting via the IBKR [REST API](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/webapi-ref/), this tool empowers users to efficiently monitor and manage overall portfolio risk by visualizing real-time risk curves and key portfolio Greeks—including delta, charm, vega, and theta. By delivering real-time risk analytics in a clear format, Trading Assistant enables users to quickly assess their portfolio’s risk profile and make well-informed adjustments to maintain their desired level of risk exposure.
